# payday

I try to write down my expenses on a daily basis. Currently, I'm using a simple excel sheet, 
where I write down the numbers and make some calculus about budgets, Paymenttype and so one.

If you think thats a great idea... it's not! I often forget to save the fail, screw up the 
setup for a new month or forget to write in the file at all.

Therefore, I plan to write API that allows me to 
1. Login into a website
2. Insert the amount, date, category, payment type and comment about an expense
3. List todays expenses (only todays for data protection)
4. write changes into a .csv file, that I may download via scp
  
Additionally, I use this project to learn about TypeScript - so the code you may see is not
perfect and I won't gurantee that it runs on any other machine than mine (I can ahrdly assure,
that that's always the case).
